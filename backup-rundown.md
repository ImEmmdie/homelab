# My data backup workflow

First i have the Ugreen NAS in RAID 5 for data storage

At home i have few external HDD around 6TB in total that i do backup of all my data on the NAS , SERVERS onto every months

My "desktop" macbook is setup to download all icloud,iphotos localy.
My 2 Macbooks all run timemachine backup daily on both the proxmox server and the ugreen nas and i do a manual one on a external NVME SSD every few weeks 

I also have multiples 3.5" HDD of differents sizes (around 4TB total) that i use for outside cold storage backup i try to make backup every few months when i can planning on improving this but now its like this 

And lastly i have cloud storage for the pictures, important documents etc.
