# next step to improve HARDWARE WISE

I'm improving everything step by step when i can and when i can justify to spend more money into this , my next improvements would be :

* Changing my current ISP plan currently have 2GB down and 1GB up but can have for same price or even little less a 8GBdown/1GBup won't do it just yet because i'm waiting to see if i can find a plan with a higher then 1GB upload speed 

* Not Using my ISP provider router even tho it is a quite good one i wanna have more control and having one where i can set things myself would be nice but this will most probably happen when i don't live with my family members because i don't wanna be called each time internet is down and i have to manual find the issue or go to the house ;)  

* getting a UPS for power loss (just to protect the hardware and data loss because where i live i'm not proned to them often or at all unless theirs a weather issue but warned about beforehand)

* Probably will be done soon but add 2 M.2 SSD's for the UGREEN NAS i don't know yet how to set them up either create a full NVME SSD storage pool for fast file transfer or use 1 SSD for HDD caching and 1 SSD for some fast storage pool without backup or maybe used to run some DOCKER APP or VM off the NAS 

* Upgrading to a 2.5GB/10GB switch so that my NAS is able to benefit from it.

*  Im looking into a SUPER LOW power consuption server (probably a PI) or other mini-pc with a external HDD that would be hosted at a family or friends house for data replication of my IMPORTANT data in case of emergency for now my solution have been COLD storage located at family/friends house and CLOUD storage for backup but having a LIVE backup option is gonna be on my next to do list.

* Maybe in the not near future get a second server for PLEX only where i could use Transcoding if i need to because for now i don't need it but as it grow bigger with more user i might need it later.

* Modeling a custom rack that could be 3D printed.

* Getting a 3D printer for various project i have and mostly make stuff to tidy up my homelab and make it more "compact" and clean looking but also some other personal project i've had for some time now.

* Just added the NAS in MAY 2025 and i'm gonna probably be fine with that much storage for quite some times but who knows maybe as my data usage get greaters might need to get a second NAS ^-^ won't be SOON at all ! 

# Future Project 

* I've used homeassistant before but never got that much into it before but one of my next "big" project is setting up a homeassistant VM to help control smart's tv / smart lights i own etc and other connected devices in the house.
